## Greetings
Thanks Emma and Alex (and Maddie!) for your work on this.

## To do

{} finish migrating 2017 bird data from word doc to spreadsheet

{} Check Emma's uploaded data for errors!

## Notes
8/14/21 Emma: Added "0" for the distance for Stationary or Incidental groups. Do we want to edit the "location" column to make the format more consistent?
